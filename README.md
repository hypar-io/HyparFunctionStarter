A repository configured with everything you need to start developing functions on Hypar.

# Getting Started
There is a task created to get you signed into Hypar.  Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the VSCode command line, then type "Run Task" looking for the Run Task command.  Then you should see "Sign in to Hypar" as the first option.

Great, now you're signed into Hypar and ready to start developing!  Go to https://hypar.io and create a new function in the UI to start developing today.
